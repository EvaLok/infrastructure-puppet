# On the production puppet servers, there is a secret common.yaml read from
# /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/data/secret, as additional Hiera layer. This can be
# configured at /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/hiera.yaml on a puppet server like so:
#
# ```
# ---
# # Hiera global configuration
# version: 5
# defaults:
#  datadir: data
# hierarchy:
#  - name: "Secrets"
#    path: "secret/common.yaml"
# ```
#
# For testing purposes, placeholders of the secrets are kept in this repo
# under data/fake_common.yaml. This way, our infra can be open source and
# locally developed, with secrets kept private. Add the following to your
# local puppet server:
#
# ```
# ---
# # Hiera global configuration
# version: 5
# defaults:
#  datadir: /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data
# hierarchy:
#  - name: "Fake secrets"
#    path: "fake_common.yaml"
# ```
#
# To avoid accidentally using fake data in production, these files
# are kept separate and mutually exclusive. When making breaking
# changes, migrate toward a new data key instead of breaking existing
# ones. Remember to add the new data to the secret repo and deploy
# it, before deploying Puppet changes that require the data.
